By leveraging models, researchers and practitioners can anticipate disease outbreaks, assess potential risks, and implement timely interventions to mitigate losses [@savary2018; @rossi2010a].\n\nMathematical modeling involves representing empirical phenomena and experimental outcomes using mathematical functions. The data used for these models may be collected specifically for modeling purposes or drawn from existing experiments and observations originally conducted to address different research questions, with such data often found in the literature [@hau1990].\n\nMathematical models integrating plant, disease, and environmental - in most cases weather-based variables - factors have been developed since the mid-1900s (See recent review by @gonzález-domínguez2023 ). Dynamic modeling of disease epidemics gained traction in the early 1960s with foundational work by Vanderplank and Zadoks, setting the stage for future advancements. Since then, researchers have contributed extensively to model development, mainly focusing on the plant disease cycle which outline pathogen development stages, such as dormancy, reproduction, dispersal, and pathogenesis, driven by interactions among host, pathogen, and environmental factors [@dewolf2007].\n\nA systematic map by @fedele2022a identified over 750 papers on plant disease models, primarily aimed at understanding system interactions (n = 680). This map revealed that while most models focus on system understanding, fewer are devoted to tactical management (n = 40), strategic planning (n = 38), or scenario analysis (n = 9).\n\nIn terms of model development, we can classify the models into two main groups based on the approach taken [@gonzález-domínguez2023]: Empirical or mechanistic approaches, which differ fundamentally in their basis, complexity and application ([@fig-approaches_modeling]).\n\n![Steps of model development from data collection to modeling based on statistical relationships (data-driven) between data collected from field or controlled environment to mechanistic approach based on the elements of the disease cycles (concept-driven).](imgs/modeling-fig1.png){#fig-approaches_modeling fig-align=\"center\" width=\"614\"}\n\n**Empirical models**, which emerged in the mid-20th century, rely on data-driven statistical relationships between variables collected under varying field or controlled environments. These models often lack cause-effect understanding, making them less robust and requiring rigorous validation and calibration when applied in diverse environments, especially in regions that did not provide data for model construction. The parameters of the model change every time new data are incorporated during model development.\n\nIn contrast, **mechanistic models**, developed from a deep understanding of biological and epidemiological processes, explain disease dynamics based on known system behaviors in response to external variables---a concept-driven approach. These dynamic models quantitatively characterize the state of the pathosystem over time, offering generally more robust predictions by utilizing mathematical equations to describe how epidemics evolve under varying environmental conditions.\n\nBoth empirical and mechanistic approaches are valid methodologies extensively used in plant pathology research. The choice between these approaches depends on several factors, including data availability, urgency in model development, and, frequently, the researcher's experience or preference. Empirical models focus on statistical relationships derived directly from data, whereas mechanistic models aim to represent the biological processes of disease progression through linked mathematical equations.\n\nIn mechanistic modeling, the equations used to predict specific disease components---such as infection frequency or the latency period---are often empirically derived from controlled experiments. For example, an infection frequency equation is typically based on data collected under specific environmental conditions, with models fitted to accurately describe observed patterns. These process-based models are then built by integrating empirically-derived equations or rules, which collectively simulate the disease cycle. Data and equations are sourced from published studies or generated from new experiments conducted by researchers.\n\nBeyond their practical predictive value, mechanistic models are valuable tools for organizing existing knowledge about a particular disease, helping to identify gaps and guide future research efforts. An example of such work is the extensive collection of comprehensive mechanistic models developed for various plant diseases by the research group led by Prof. Vittorio Rossi in Italy [@rossi2008; @rossi2014; @salotti2023; @salotti2022].\n\nThis chapter focuses mainly on empirical modeling. We begin by examining the types of data utilized in model development, focusing on those collected under controlled conditions, such as replicated laboratory or growth chamber experiments, as well as field data collected from several locations and years. We will also analyze real-world case studies, drawing on examples from the literature to replicate and understand model applications. Through these examples, we aim to illustrate the process of fitting models to data and underscore the role of modeling in advancing plant disease management practices.\n\n## Controlled environment\n\nIn this section, we will demonstrate, using examples from the literature, how statistical models can be fitted to data that represent various stages of the disease cycle.\n\nResearch on disease-environment interactions under controlled conditions - such as laboratory or growth chamber studies - lays the groundwork for building foundational models, including infection-based models and sub-models for specific processes like dormancy, dispersal, infection, and latency [@krause1975; @magarey2005; @dewolf2007].\n\nGrowth chambers and phytotrons are essential for testing the effects of individual variables, though these controlled results may not fully replicate field conditions. Anyway, laboratory experiments help clarify specific questions by isolating interactions, unlike complex field trials where host, pathogen, and environment factors interact. Polycyclic or \"mini epidemic\" experiments enable observation of disease dynamics under targeted conditions [@hau1990; @rotem1988].\n\nOnce developed, these sub-models can be incorporated into larger mechanistic models that simulate the entire disease cycle, thereby mimicking disease progression over time [@rossi2008; @salotti2023]. Alternatively, sub-models can also be used in stand-alone predictive systems where the process being modeled - such as infection - is the key factor in determining disease occurrence [@machardy1989; @magarey2007]. For example, infection sub-models can be integrated into prediction systems that help schedule crop protection measures by forecasting when infection risk is highest.\n\n### Infection-based models\n\nTo model infection potential based on environmental factors, simple rules can be used with daily weather data, such as temperature and rainfall thresholds [@magarey2002]. Simple decision aids, such as charts and graphs, also exist to help model infection potential by using combinations of daily average temperature and hours of wetness. These tools offer a straightforward approach to evaluate infection risks based on readily available weather data, supporting decision-making without complex modeling [@seem1984]. However, for many pathogens, hourly data is needed, requiring complex models that track favorable conditions hour by hour. These models start with specific triggers and can reset due to conditions like dryness or low humidity, simulating a biological clock for infection risk assessment [@magarey2007].\n\nModeling approaches vary based on available data and model goals. A common method is the matrix approach, like the Wallin potato late blight model, which uses rows for temperature and columns for moisture duration to estimate disease severity [@krause1975] (see previous chapter on [warning systems](https://r4pde.net/prediction-warning-systems)). Bailey enhanced this with an interactive matrix that combines temperature, relative humidity, and duration to assess infection risk across pathogens, making it versatile for various modeling needs [@bailey1999].\n\nWhen infection responses are measured at various temperature and wetness combinations, regression models can be developed to predict infection rates. These models often use polynomial, logistic, or complex three-dimensional response surface equations to represent the relationship between environmental conditions and infection potential. In an excellent review title \"*How to create and deploy infection models for plant pathogen*s\" @magarey2007 discusses that many modeling approaches lack biological foundations and are not generic, making them unsuitable for developing a unified set of disease forecast models. While three-dimensional response surfaces, such as those created with sufficient temperature-moisture observations, offer detailed infection responses, they are often too complex and data-intensive for widespread use (seeTable 1 adapted from @magarey2007).\n\n| Approach                                                               | Strengths                                                                                                          | Weaknesses                                                                               |\n|-------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Matrix [@krause1975; @mills1944; @windels1998]                         | Easy; converts moisture/temperature combinations into severity values or risk categories.

Source: @magarey2007\n\nIn the following sections, I will demonstrate how various biologically meaningful models fit infection data, using temperature, wetness duration, or a combination of both as predictors.\n\n#### Temperature effects\n\n##### Generalized beta-function\n\nAmong several non-linear models that can be fitted to infection responses to temperature, the generalized beta-function is an interesting alternative [@hau1990]. This is a nonlinear model with five parameters. Two of them, namely $b$ and $c$ , have a biological meaning because they are estimates of the minimum and maximum temperature of the biological process under consideration.\n\nWe will use a subset of the data obtained from a study conducted under controlled conditions that aimed to assess the influence of temperature on the symptom development of citrus canker in sweet orange [@dallapria2006]. The data used here is only for severity on the cultivar Hamlin (plot a in @fig-temperature). The data was extracted using the R package {digitize} as shown [here on this tweet](https://twitter.com/edelponte/status/1580320409794539520?s=20&t=KqjJPmwzFVKm8Gu7Ss-P6A).\n\n![Effect of temperature (12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 or 40°C) on disease severity of citrus canker on sweet orange cvs Hamlin (a), Natal (b), Pera (c) and Valencia (d) with a leaf wetness duration of 24 h.

Magarey's generic infection model\n\nIn the early 2000s, Magarey and collaborators [@magarey2005] proposed a generic infection model for foliar fungal pathogens, designed to predict infection periods based on limited data on temperature and wetness requirements. The model uses cardinal temperatures (minimum, optimum, maximum) and the minimum wetness duration (Wmin) necessary for infection. The model can incorporate inputs based on estimated cardinal temperatures and surface wetness duration. These values are available for numerous pathogens and can be consulted in the literature (See table 2 of the paper by @magarey2005).\n\nThe model utilizes a temperature response function, which is adjusted to the pathogen's minimum and optimum wetness duration needs, allowing it to be broadly applicable even with limited data on specific pathogens. The model was validated with data from 53 studies, showing good accuracy and adaptability, even for pathogens lacking comprehensive data [@magarey2005].\n\nThe function is given by\n\n$f(T) = \\left( \\frac{T_{\\text{max}} - T}{T_{\\text{max}} - T_{\\text{opt}}} \\right)^{\\frac{T_{\\text{opt}} - T_{\\text{min}}}{T_{\\text{max}} - T_{\\text{opt}}}} \\times \\left( \\frac{T - T_{\\text{min}}}{T_{\\text{opt}} - T_{\\text{min}}} \\right)^{\\frac{T_{\\text{opt}} - T_{\\text{min}}}{T_{\\text{opt}} - T_{\\text{min}}}}$\n\nwhere $T$ is the temperature, $T_{\\text{min}}$ is the minimum temperature, $T_{\\text{opt}}$ is the optimum temperature, and $T_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum temperature for infection.\n\nThe wetness duration requirement is given by\n\n$W(T) = \\frac{W_{\\text{min}}}{f(T)} \\leq W_{\\text{max}}$\n\nwhere $W_{\\text{min}}$ is the minimum wetness duration requirement, and $W_{\\text{max}}$ is an optional upper limit on $W(T)$.\n\nLet's write the functions for estimating the required wetness duration at each temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntemp_response <- function(T, Tmin, Topt, Tmax) {\n  if (T < Tmin || T > Tmax) {\n    return(0)\n  } else {\n    ((Tmax - T) / (Tmax - Topt))^((Topt - Tmin) / (Tmax - Topt)) * \n    ((T - Tmin) / (Topt - Tmin))^((Topt - Tmin) / (Topt - Tmin))\n  }\n}\n\n# Define the function to calculate wetness duration requirement W(T)\nwetness_duration <- function(T, Wmin, Tmin, Topt, Tmax, Wmax = Inf) {\n  f_T <- temp_response(T, Tmin, Topt, Tmax)\n  if (f_T == 0) {\n    return(0)  # Infinite duration required if outside temperature range\n  }\n  W <- Wmin / f_T\n  return(min(W, Wmax))  # Apply Wmax as an upper limit if specified\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's set the parameters for the fungus *Venturia inaequalis*, the cause of apple scab.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Parameters for Venturia inaequalis (apple scab)\nT <- seq(0, 35, by = 0.5) \nWmin <- 6                  \nTmin <- 1                  \nTopt <- 20                 \nTmax <- 35                 \nWmax <- 40.5                \n\n# Calculate wetness duration required at each temperature\nW_T <- sapply(T, wetness_duration, Wmin, Tmin, Topt, Tmax, Wmax)\n\ntemperature_data_applescab <- data.frame(\n  Temperature = T,\n  Wetness_Duration = W_T\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now the parameters for the fungus *Phakopsora pachyrhizi*, the cause of soybean rust in soybean.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Parameters for Phakposora pachyrhizi\nT <- seq(0, 35, by = 0.5)  \nWmin <- 8                \nTmin <- 10                  \nTopt <- 23                 \nTmax <- 28                \nWmax <- 12                 \n\n# Calculate wetness duration required at each temperature\nW_T <- sapply(T, wetness_duration, Wmin, Tmin, Topt, Tmax, Wmax)\n\ntemperature_data_soyrust <- data.frame(\n  Temperature = T,\n  Wetness_Duration = W_T)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can produce the plots for each pathogen.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\napplescab <- ggplot(temperature_data_applescab, aes(x = Temperature, y = Wetness_Duration)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"black\", linewidth = 1, linetype =1) +\n  theme_r4pde(font_size = 14)+\n  labs(x = \"Temperature (°C)\", y = \"Wetness Duration (hours)\", \n       subtitle = \"Venturia inaequalis\")+\n  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"italic\"))\n\nsoyrust <- ggplot(temperature_data_soyrust, aes(x = Temperature, y = Wetness_Duration)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"black\", linewidth = 1, linetype =1) +\n  theme_r4pde(font_size = 14)+\n  labs(x = \"Temperature (°C)\", y = \"Wetness Duration (hours)\", \n       subtitle = \"Phakopsora pachyrizhi\")+ \n  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"italic\"))\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\napplescab | soyrust\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](prediction-disease-modeling_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n### Latency period models\n\nThe latent period can be defined as \"the length of time between the start of the infection process by a unit of inoculum and the start of production of infectious units\" [@madden2007]. The latent period, analogous to the reproductive maturity age of nonparasitic organisms, defines the generation time between infections and is a key factor in pathogen development and epidemic progress in plant disease epidemiology [@plantdi1963]. As a critical trait of aggressiveness, especially in polycyclic diseases, it largely determines the potential number of infection cycles within a season, impacting the overall epidemic intensity [@lannou2012].\n\n#### Parabolic function\n\nThe effects of temperature on the length of the incubation and latent periods of hawthorn powdery mildew, caused by *Podosphaera clandestina*, were studied by @xu2000. In that work, the authors inoculated the leaves and, each day after inoculation, the upper surface of each leaf was examined for mildew colonies and conidiophores using a pen-microscope (×50). Sporulation was recorded at the leaf level, noting the number of colonies and the first appearance dates of colonies and sporulation for each leaf.\n\nThe latent period (LP) was defined as the time from inoculation to the first day of observed sporulation on the leaf. Due to the skewed distribution of LP across temperatures and inoculations, medians were used to summarize LP rather than means [@xu2000].\n\nLet's look at two plots extracted from the paper. The first, on the left-hand side, is the original number of days of the latent period of each evaluated temperature (note: the solid symbol is for constant temperature while the open circle is for fluctuating temperature). On the right-hand side, the relationship between temperature and rates of development of powdery mildew under constant temperature during the latent periods; the solid line indicates the fitted model. The rate of fungal development was calculated as the reciprocal of the corresponding observed incubation (in hours) and latent periods.\n\n![Source: @xu2000](imgs/modeling-latent.png){#fig-latent fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThe latent period data in days for the solid black circle (constant temperature) above was extracted using the {digitize} R package.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlatent <- tibble::tribble(\n   ~T, ~days,\n  10L,   13L,\n  11L,   16L,\n  13L,    8L,\n  14L,    9L,\n  15L,    7L,\n  16L,    7L,\n  17L,    6L,\n  18L,    6L,\n  19L,    6L,\n  20L,    6L,\n  21L,    5L,\n  22L,    5L,\n  23L,    6L,\n  24L,    6L,\n  25L,    5L,\n  26L,    7L,\n  27L,    7L,\n  28L,   10L\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's reproduce the two plots using the datapoints.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#|fig-width: 10\n#|fig-height: 4\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(r4pde)\n\np_latent <- latent |> \n  ggplot(aes(T, days))+\n  geom_point()+\n  theme_r4pde()\n\nlatent_rate <- data.frame(\n  T = latent$T,  # Scale temperature\n  R = 1/latent$days/24\n)\n\np_latent_rate <- latent_rate |> \n  ggplot(aes(T, R))+\n  geom_point()+\n  theme_r4pde()\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\np_latent | p_latent_rate\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](prediction-disease-modeling_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will fit the parabolic function proposed by @bernard2013 which predicts a thermal response curve (developmental rate, R), which is the relationship between the inverse of latent period and temperature.

In most cases, these models primarily rely on weather variables as predictors [@gonzález-domínguez2023]. This focus reflects the critical role of weather in driving key processes in the disease cycle, such as pathogen survival, dispersal, host infection, and reproduction [@dewolf2007]. Consequently, a primary objective for plant epidemiologists is to identify and quantify the relationships between weather conditions and measures of disease intensity [@shah2019; @eljarroudi2017; @pietravalle2003; @coakley1988; @delponte2006; @shah2013; @coakley1988a].\n\nIn modeling efforts, the disease variable can be represented either as a continuous measure (e.g., incidence or severity) or as categorical data, which may be binary (e.g., non-epidemic vs. epidemic) or multinomial (e.g., low, moderate, and high severity). This variability in response types informs the selection of suitable modeling techniques, ensuring that the model accurately captures the nature of the data and the relationships between weather variables and disease outcomes.\n\nIn this section, I will demonstrate several modeling approaches that can be applied when field data is available. These examples will cover a range of techniques, starting with variable construction, which involves transforming raw weather data into summary measures that can effectively represent conditions relevant to disease outcomes. Next, variable selection methods will be explored to identify the most influential predictors, ensuring that models are both accurate and interpretable. The focus will then shift to model fitting, showing how different models, such as linear and logistic regression, can be used to capture relationships between weather variables and disease endpoints. Finally, model evaluation will be addressed, emphasizing metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and area under the curve (AUC), which are crucial for assessing the predictive performance and reliability of the models developed.\n\n### Variable construction and selection\n\nVariable construction, particularly for weather-related variables, involves not only data transformation methods but also requires an understanding of how diseases respond to specific weather conditions at particular growth stages [@decól2024; @dewolf2003]. This approach ensures that the variables derived accurately capture biologically relevant processes, improving the realism and relevance of the model inputs.\n\nIn addition, data mining techniques are employed to systematically explore time-series data and identify potential weather-disease relationships [@shah2019; @pietravalle2003; @coakley1988]. These techniques involve creating lagged variables, moving averages, or window-based summaries that capture delayed or cumulative effects of weather on disease outcomes. By integrating system knowledge with data mining, researchers aim to construct variables that are both biologically meaningful and statistically robust, improving the chances of identifying predictors that enhance model accuracy and interpretability.\n\n#### Window-pane\n\n##### Variable construction\n\nWith regards to weather variable creation and selection for data-mining purposes, window-pane analysis, first introduced in the mid-1980s [@coakley1985], has been widely used in modeling studies in plant pathology [@pietravalle2003; @calverojr1996; @tebeest2008a; @gouache2015a; @coakley1988; @kriss2010; @dallalana2021; @coakley1988a]. This method aids in identifying weather conditions that are most strongly associated with disease outcomes by segmenting a continuous time series (e.g. daily temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall), into discrete, fixed-length windows.\n\nThe analysis involves summarizing conditions within each window (e.g., mean, sum, count) and correlating these summaries with disease outcomes, which may be expressed as continuous measures (e.g., severity) or as categorical variables (e.g., low vs. high levels). This approach allows users to set specific start and end times, as well as window lengths, enabling the exploration of different temporal relationships between weather and disease. By sliding the start and end points along the series, multiple overlapping windows are generated, making it possible to identify the most informative variables for modeling. The selected optimal fixed-time and fixed-window-length variables derived from this analysis serve as predictors in model development, helping to improve the accuracy and relevance of disease forecasting models.\n\nHere's an R code that demonstrates how the windows are defined over a 28-day period using four fixed window lengths (7, 14, 21, and 28 days), generating a total of 46 variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Define total days and window lengths\nmax_days <- 28\nwindow_lengths <- c(7, 14, 21, 28)\n\n# Create an empty data frame for all sliding windows\nwindow_data <- data.frame()\n\n# Populate the data frame with start and end points for each window\nvar_id <- 1  # Variable ID for each window\n\nfor (length in sort(window_lengths)) {  # Sort window lengths from shortest to longest\n  for (start_day in 0:(max_days - length)) {\n    end_day <- start_day + length\n    window_data <- rbind(\n      window_data,\n      data.frame(\n        start = start_day,\n        end = end_day,\n        var_id = var_id,\n        window_length = length\n      )\n    )\n    var_id <- var_id + 1  # Increment variable ID\n  }\n}\n\n# Convert window_length to a factor for correct ordering in the legend\nwindow_data$window_length <- factor(window_data$window_length, levels = sort(unique(window_data$window_length)))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwindow_data |> \n  ggplot(aes(x = start, xend = end, y = var_id, yend = var_id)) +\n  geom_segment(linewidth = 2) +  # Line segments for each window\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:max_days, limits = c(0, max_days)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:var_id) +\n  labs(title = \"Window-pane\",\n    subtitle = \"Each variable of 7, 14, 21 and 28 days length over 28 days\",\n    x = \"Days\", y = \"Variable ID\", color = \"Window Length (days)\") +\n  r4pde::theme_r4pde(font_size = 14) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](prediction-disease-modeling_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe window pane analysis requires a spreadsheet program [@kriss2010] or a specific algorithm that automates the creation of sliding windows at defined starting and ending times relative to a reference date. In the seminal work, software was programmed in the FORTRAN language and named WINDOW [@coakley1985]. It enabled the creation of windows and the calculation of summary statistics, including correlation with disease severity. Building on the original idea, a Genstat 6.1 algorithm was developed in the early 2000s, incorporating further adjustments such as the implementation of bootstrapping analysis to validate correlations and misclassifications identified by window pane [@pietravalle2003; @tebeest2008a]. More recently, window pane analysis including variable creation and analysis has been conducted in R using custom-made scripts [@gouache2015a; @dallalana2021].\n\nI will demonstrate the `windowpane()` function of the {r4pde} package developed to facilitate the creation of variables using the window pane approach. First, let's load a dataset that contains information on the disease, as well as metadata, including a key date that will be used as the starting point for window creation.

The function has several arguments. Note the two date variables: `end_date`, which serves as the reference for sliding the windows, and `date_col`, which represents the date for each day in the time series. The `summary_type` specifies the statistic to be calculated, while the `direction` determines whether the sliding windows will move backward, forward, or in both directions relative to the end date. Lastly, the `group_by` argument specifies the index variable for the epidemic or study.\n\nWe will create new variables based on the mean daily temperature (T2M), with each variable representing the mean value over one of the four window lengths (7, 14, 21, and 28 days) defined in the `window_length` argument.

Usually, Spearman's rank correlation can be preferred due to its ability to measure monotonic relationships and its robustness to outliers. In other cases, Spearman was used because the disease data was ordinal [@kriss2010].\n\nIn a recent study, @dallalana2021, differing from @kriss2010, proposed the estimation of the precision of these correlations via bootstrapping, where a high number of samples (e.g. 1000) are randomly drawn (with replacement) from the original dataset. For each bootstrap sample, correlations between weather variables and disease outcomes are calculated, and the average across samples is used as the final measure of association. This approach ensures a more reliable estimation of the correlations by capturing variability and improving statistical robustness.\n\nThe window-pane analysis involves numerous tests, as each time window generates a separate test statistic. Because many tests are conducted, the global significance level becomes higher than the critical significance level set for individual tests, increasing the risk of false positives [@kriss2010]. Additionally, the correlations among test statistics are influenced by overlapping time windows, shared data, and large-scale climatic patterns. To address this issue, @kriss2010 proposed the use of the Simes' method, which tests the global null hypothesis that none of the individual correlations are significant. Simes' method orders p-values and rejects the global null hypothesis if any adjusted p-value meets a specific threshold.\n\nWhile this method indicates whether at least one correlation is significant, it does not provide significance for individual correlations. Therefore, the authors proposed that the individual correlation coefficients should be compared against a more stringent significance level (α = 0.005 instead of 0.05), reducing the likelihood of false positives but increasing false negatives. Although this adjustment is independent of the Simes' method, there was a general alignment: significant global results often corresponded to significant individual correlations, and non-significant global results typically lacked significant individual correlations [@kriss2010].\n\nLet's calculate the bootstrapped correlation coefficients combined with the Sime's method. First, we need to subset our variables to the specific combination of weather and window.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n  T2M_MIN_7 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length7_T2M_MIN_mean\"))\n  T2M_MIN_14 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length14_T2M_MIN_mean\"))\n  T2M_MIN_21 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length21_T2M_MIN_mean\"))\n  T2M_MIN_28 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length28_T2M_MIN_mean\"))\n \n  T2M_MAX_7 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length7_T2M_MAX_mean\"))\n  T2M_MAX_14 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length14_T2M_MAX_mean\"))\n  T2M_MAX_21 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length21_T2M_MAX_mean\"))\n  T2M_MAX_28 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length28_T2M_MAX_mean\"))\n  \n  T2M_7 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length7_T2M_mean\"))\n  T2M_14 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length14_T2M_mean\"))\n  T2M_21 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length21_T2M_mean\"))\n  T2M_28 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length28_T2M_mean\"))\n  \n  RH2M_7 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length7_RH2M_mean\"))\n  RH2M_14 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length14_RH2M_mean\"))\n  RH2_21 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length21_RH2M_mean\"))\n  RH2_28 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length28_RH2M_mean\"))\n  \n  PRECTOTCORR_7 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length7_PRECTOTCORR\"))\n  PRECTOTCORR_14 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length14_PRECTOTCORR\"))\n  PRECTOTCORR_21 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length21_PRECTOTCORR\"))\n  PRECTOTCORR_28 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length28_PRECTOTCORR\"))\n  \n  T2M_MINb_7 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length7_T2M_MIN_below\"))\n  T2M_MINb_14 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length14_T2M_MIN_below\"))\n  T2M_MINb_21 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length21_T2M_MIN_below\"))\n  T2M_MINb_28 = wp_all |> select(starts_with(\"length28_T2M_MIN_below\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we can use the `windowpane_tests()` function from the {r4pde} package to analyze each of the datasets created above.

variable, the number of days when the TMIN was lower than 15 ^o^C, and the selected predictors over a 7-day period. The correlations range from approximately -0.56 to -0.50, with all P-values below the global significance threshold after Simes' correction, suggesting that these predictors are robustly associated with the response.\n\nThe global P-value, which accounts for multiple testing, is exceptionally low, confirming a significant overall relationship, while the highest observed correlation is -0.50.

All 7-day-length variables but maximum temperature were strongly associated with the incidence of wheat blast. These three variables can be used as candidates for developing predictions models.\n\n#### Functional data analysis\n\nFunctional Data Analysis (FDA) is a statistical approach used to analyze and model data that varies continuously over time or space. It represents entire data sequences (e.g., time series) as smooth functions, allowing for the exploration of trends, patterns, and relationships in complex, continuous processes rather than relying on discrete, segmented data points [@ramsay2005functional; @Gertheiss2024].\n\nIn the FDA framework, scalar-on-function and function-on-scalar models are two types of FDA models, designed to examine relationships between functional predictors and outcomes. Function-on-scalar models use single values (e.g., mean daily relative humidity) as predictors to explain the shape of an entire outcome curve (e.g. disease). Meanwhile, in scalar-on-function models, time series data (e.g., daily temperatures) are used as predictors to identify which parts of the series are linked to a single outcome. Together, these FDA models offer complementary insights, allowing either for predicting a scalar outcome from curves or understanding how scalar predictors influence entire functions [@ramsay2005functional].\n\nInitially applied in plant pathology to study the relationship between Fusarium head blight outbreaks and weather variables over time (using the function-on-scalar model) [@shah2019a], FDA has since been adopted in other plant pathology studies with similar objectives [@shah2019; @hjelkrem2021a; @alves2022a].\n\nIn particular, @shah2019 used FDA as a basis to develop logistic regression models for large-scale deployment by utilizing FDA through a scalar-on-function approach to predict plant diseases - in this approach, the model identifies which parts of the time series (e.g., certain weeks or days) are most associated with the disease outcome, helping to predict whether an epidemic is likely to occur based on patterns in the weather series. Moreover, FDA was employed to identify the most relevant temporal regions of weather series associated with disease outbreaks, improving prediction by summarizing key windows across critical growth stages. The authors discussed that , unlike traditional window-pane analysis, FDA reduces statistical testing issues and offers a more refined method for incorporating novel predictors into simple, effective models [@shah2019].\n\nWith the objective of identifying temporal regions of the weather series, Alves et al. (unpublished) proposed the use of a function-on-scalar model to gain insights about the time series related to a binary disease outcome by identifying significant regions in the weather series where the curves diverge. The function-on-scalar approach here compares the average functional trajectories of two groups: epidemic vs. non-epidemic. It identifies time regions where the mean weather curves for the two groups differ significantly. While the model doesn't directly predict a binary response, it aids in diagnosing critical time points in the series that differentiate the two disease outcomes, supporting model development and refinement for binary classification.\n\nFor that purpose, the authors used the `ITP2bspline()` function of the R package {fdatest} that implements the Interval Testing Procedure (ITP) to compare two functional populations (epidemic vs. non-epidemic) evaluated on a uniform grid. It represents data using B-spline basis functions and assesses the significance of each basis coefficient with interval-wise control of the Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) [@pini2016].\n\nIn this section, I will first demonstrate how to fit the function-on-scalar regression with the objective of visualizing two curves, the difference coefficient function and the overall mean coefficient curve. The former shows how the effect of a weather-related variable on the response variable changes over the days relative to a reference date (e.g. planting date, flowering). It helps to identify critical windows when the weather variations have the most substantial impact. The latter represents the cumulative or overall effect of weather over the time period. It helps assess whether the influence of weather variable accumulates or stabilizes over time.\n\nThen, I will demonstrate the Interval Testing Procedure (ITP) to compare two functional populations (epidemic vs. non-epidemic) and identify exactly the days in the series that the two populations are significantly different. We will keep analyzing the data on wheat blast epidemics in Brazil.\n\n##### Function-on-scalar regression\n\nThe following analysis uses function-on-scalar regression to explore the relationship between relative humidity at 2 meters (RH2M) and the occurrence of wheat blast epidemics. Let's first load the necessary libraries.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(r4pde)\nlibrary(refund)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step involves reading and merging two datasets:\n\n\\- `trials`: Contains disease data with heading dates.\n\n\\- `weather_data`: Contains weather data for specific time windows. It was created in the previous section on window pane and can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emdelponte/epidemiology-R/refs/heads/main/data/weather_windowpane.csv).\n\nThe datasets are merged into `trials_weather`, and the resulting data is transformed into a wide format where each column represents time points (days), and rows correspond to individual studies. The binary epidemic status is created, where:\n\n-   1 indicates an epidemic (if `inc_mean > 20`).\n-   0 indicates no epidemic (if `inc_mean <= 20`).\n\nThe weather variable (`RH2M`) is used as the predictor, and time points (days) are calculated relative to the heading date.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load the disease datase\ntrials <- r4pde::BlastWheat\ntrials$heading = as.Date(trials$heading, format = \"%d-%m-%Y\")\n\n# load the weather data constructed in previous section\nweather_data <- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emdelponte/epidemiology-R/refs/heads/main/data/weather_windowpane.csv\")\ntrials_weather <- full_join(trials, weather_data)\n\n# create epidemic variable and number of days relative to heading\ndat_wide_RH <- trials_weather |>\n    mutate(epidemic = if_else(inc_mean > 20, 1, 0),\n           days = as.numeric(-(heading - YYYYMMDD))) |>\n    dplyr::select(study, epidemic, days, RH2M) |>\n    pivot_wider(id_cols = c(study, epidemic), \n                names_from = days, values_from = RH2M)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe response vector is the epidemic status (0 or 1), while the predictor matrix contains the values of the specified weather variable across time. The model fits smooth functions to represent the effects of time and the epidemic status on the weather variable using penalized splines. The function-on-scalar regression model is given by:\n\n$y_{ij} = \\beta_0(t_j) + \\beta_1(t_j) x_i + \\epsilon_{ij}$\n\nwhere: $y_{ij}$ is the value of the weather variable for study $i$ at time $j$; $\\beta_0(t_j)$ is the smooth function for the overall mean effect over time; $\\beta_1(t_j)$ is the smooth function representing the effect of epidemic status over time; $x_i$ is the binary epidemic status (0 or 1); and $\\epsilon{ij}$ is the error term.\n\nWe can now fit the model using the `pffr()` function of the {refund} package.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <-

and relative humidity had a significant influence across the entire range of days, particularly during the pre-heading period. Maximum temperature did not affect the epidemics at any time. Lastly, precipitation influenced wheat blast during several short intervals, with the most notable impact occurring over a longer seven-day period around the heading stage. Therefore, TMIN, RH and PREC can be tested further as candidate predictors in prediction models.\n\n### Model fitting\n\n#### Logistic regression models\n\nLogistic regression is a statistical modeling technique used to predict the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables [@james2021]. In the context of plant disease prediction, the logistic model relates factors like environmental conditions (usually weather), host characteristics (e.g., cultivar resistance), and pathogen presence to the likelihood of disease occurrence. This occurrence can be expressed as presence or absence [@mila2004] or as a classification of incidence/severity based on an epidemic threshold [@dewolf2003; @decól2024]. By integrating these variables, the model enables researchers to assess disease risk under varying conditions and to develop decision support systems. This modeling approach has been used successfully in several studies in the field [@harikrishnan2008; @xu2013; @romero2021; @shah2013; @mila2004; @decól2024; @willbur2018; @dewolf2003], demonstrating its efficacy in predicting disease outbreaks and informing early intervention efforts.\n\nThe logistic model uses the logistic function to transform a linear combination of predictors into a probability between 0 and 1. This transformation ensures that the predicted values are valid probabilities, facilitating meaningful interpretations. By estimating the influence of each predictor on the odds of disease, logistic regression helps identify significant risk factors. Additionally, the model's coefficients provide insights into the strength and direction of the association between predictors and disease risk, offering valuable information for understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease development and progression.\n\nThe logistic regression model predicts the probability $P$ of the binary outcome $Y = 1 \\mid X$ (e.g., presence or absence of disease) given a set of predictor variables $X$. The model uses the logistic function to ensure the predicted probabilities lie between 0 and 1:\n\n$P(Y = 1 \\mid X) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p)}}$\n\nAlternatively, the model can be expressed in terms of the log-odds (also known as the logit function):\n\n$\\log\\left( \\frac{P(Y = 1 \\mid X)}{1 - P(Y = 1 \\mid X)} \\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\dots + \\beta_p X_p$\n\nCompared to more complex machine learning models, logistic regression offers a high degree of interpretability, which is crucial in many scientific and practical applications. While models like neural networks, random forests, or support vector machines can achieve high predictive accuracy, they often function as \"black boxes\" where the relationship between predictors and the outcome is not easily understood [@molnar2019]. In contrast, logistic regression provides clear and direct interpretations of model parameters, allowing researchers and practitioners to understand how each predictor variable influences the probability of disease occurrence. This transparency makes logistic regression a preferred choice in contexts where explaining the underlying relationships is as important as prediction accuracy. The balance between interpretability and predictive performance justifies the choice of logistic regression in several contexts, especially when insights into the data are essential for decision-making, which is the case in plant disease prediction contexts.\n\nIn this section, we will keep working with the wheat blast disease data and expand on the previous sections on variable construction and selection, a usual step prior to testing the prediction variables in the logistic regression model.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(r4pde)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# load the disease datase\ntrials <- r4pde::BlastWheat\ntrials$heading = as.Date(trials$heading, format = \"%d-%m-%Y\")\n\n# load the weather data \nweather_data <- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emdelponte/epidemiology-R/refs/heads/main/data/weather_windowpane.csv\")\n\n# join the two datasets\ntrials_weather <- full_join(trials, weather_data)\n\n# create epidemic variable and number of days relative to heading\ntrials_weather <- trials_weather |>\n    mutate(epidemic = if_else(inc_mean > 20, 1, 0),\n           days = as.numeric(-(heading - YYYYMMDD)))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's create a few weather-related variables based on the original variables available from the NASA POWER.

This suggests that warmer and more humid conditions may increase the likelihood of an epidemic, aligning with expectations for many plant diseases.\n\nWe can check the accuracy of the model in predicting the training data\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(caret)\n\n# Obtain the predicted probability\npred_probs <- predict(m_logistic, epi_weather, type = \"response\")\n\n# Convert probabilities to binary outcomes using 0.5 as the threshold\npred_classes <- ifelse(pred_probs >= 0.5, 1, 0)\n\n# Calculate accuracy\nactual_classes <- epi_weather$epidemic\naccuracy <- mean(pred_classes == actual_classes)\naccuracy\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.7832168\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe `confusionMatrix()` function of the {caret} package gives a more complete information about the perfomrance of the model on the training set.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create the confusion matrix\nconfusionMatrix(data = as.factor(as.numeric(pred_probs > 0.50)),  mode= \"everything\",  reference = as.factor(epi_weather$epidemic))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nConfusion Matrix and Statistics\n\n          Reference\nPrediction  0  1\n         0 47 13\n         1 18 65\n                                          \n               Accuracy : 0.7832          \n                 95% CI : (0.7066, 0.8477)\n    No Information Rate : 0.5455          \n    P-Value [Acc > NIR] : 2.797e-09       \n                                          \n                  Kappa : 0.56            \n                                          \n Mcnemar's Test P-Value : 0.4725          \n                                          \n            Sensitivity : 0.7231          \n            Specificity : 0.8333          \n         Pos Pred Value : 0.7833          \n         Neg Pred Value : 0.7831          \n              Precision : 0.7833          \n                 Recall : 0.7231          \n                     F1 : 0.7520          \n             Prevalence : 0.4545          \n         Detection Rate : 0.3287          \n   Detection Prevalence : 0.4196          \n      Balanced Accuracy : 0.7782          \n                                          \n       'Positive' Class : 0               \n                                          \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can conclude that using only two variables from relatively long periods before heading, the model can reasonably predict wheat blast. We can further explore the effect of other variables from the post-heading period, as well as variables from shorter intervals around heading and flowering---periods when infections are likely to occur.\n\nFor instance, in the FDA section, rainfall around heading was significantly associated with the epidemics. In the original paper, the best models with two to five predictors achieved accuracies between 0.80 and 0.85, with one model including rainfall during the 7-day period after heading, consistent with the FDA results from the previous section.\n\nVariable selection is a critical process that combines statistical techniques with biological knowledge to identify the most relevant predictors for a given model. Approaches can range from simple methods, like selecting the most correlated variables at periods of time know as most critical for infection or epidemic development [@dewolf2003], to more advanced algorithms designed to optimize predictive power, such as regularization techniques like lasso or elastic-net [@decól2024; @dallalana2021a; @dewolf2023].\n\nRegularization methods not only help in selecting significant predictors but also in handling multicollinearity and reducing model complexity [@hastie2009]. These methods will be demonstrated further in the following sections, where Lasso and similar techniques are discussed in detail.\n",
