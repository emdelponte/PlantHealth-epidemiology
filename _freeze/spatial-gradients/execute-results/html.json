This study was conducted using experimental plots in the Philippines during the wet seasons of 1994 and 1995.\n\nThe data were made available [in this tutorial](https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/disimpactmngmnt/topc/EcologyAndEpidemiologyInR/ModelingDispersalGradients/Pages/PrimaryDiseaseGradientsofBacteria.aspx). We enter the data manually and then produce two plots, one for each year.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(r4pde)\ntheme_set(theme_r4pde())\n\nxo <- \ntibble::tribble(\n    ~d,   ~y4,   ~y5,\n     0, 3.083, 7.185,\n  0.22, 0.521,  0.38,\n  0.44, 0.083, 0.157,\n  0.66, 0.021, 0.028\n  )\n\ng1 <- xo |> \n  ggplot(aes(d, y4))+\n theme_r4pde()+\n  geom_point(size = 2)+\n  geom_line()+\n  ylim(0,8)+\n  labs(y = \"Number of new lesions\",\n       x = \"Distance (m)\",\n       title = \"1994 wet season\")\n\ng2 <- xo |> \n  ggplot(aes(d, y5))+\n  theme_r4pde()+\n  geom_point(size = 2)+\n  geom_line()+\n  ylim(0,8)+\n  labs(y = \"Number of new lesions\",\n       x = \"Distance (m)\",\n       title = \"1995 wet season\")\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\n(g1 | g2) +  plot_annotation(\n    caption = \"Source: Mundt et al.

This data was collected during a field experiment conducted at Hermiston in 2002, as reported in Sackett's 2005 study [@Sackett2005]. Later, the data was made publicly available in 2015, courtesy of Mikaberidze [@mikaberidze2015]. For our discussion, we'll manually input the data in a tibble format.\n\nThis tibble contains five columns. The first and second columns represent distances from the source of infection, denoted in feet and meters, respectively. The remaining three columns consist of measures of stripe rust severity, each from a separate replicated plot. These measurements offer us a quantifiable view of the disease gradient of stripe rust in the field, thereby shedding light on the infection's spatial distribution and intensity.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhermiston <- \n  tibble::tribble(\n  ~dist_f, ~dist_m,  ~`1`,  ~`2`,  ~`3`,\n  0,        0,    65,    65,    39,\n  5,      1.5,    35,    44,   7.5,\n  10,       3,  21.5,  14.5,  1.75,\n  20,     6.1,     8,  0.75,   0.2,\n  40,    12.2,     1,  0.08, 0.025,\n  60,    18.3,  0.25, 0.026, 0.015,\n  80,    24.4, 0.035, 0.015, 0.009,\n  100,   30.5,  0.01, 0.003, 0.008,\n  120,   36.6, 0.008, 0.016,  0.01,\n  140,   42.7, 0.003, 0.003,  0.01,\n  160,   48.8, 0.001, 0.006, 0.006,\n  180,   54.9, 0.001, 0.002, 0.002,\n  200,     61, 0.001, 0.003, 0.004,\n  220,   67.1, 0.001, 0.003, 0.002,\n  240,   73.2, 0.001, 0.001,     0,\n  260,   79.2, 0.001, 0.002,     0,\n  280,   85.3, 0.001, 0.001,     0,\n  300,   91.4, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\nhermiston |> \n  pivot_longer(3:5, names_to = \"replicate\", values_to = \"severity\") |> \n  ggplot(aes(dist_m, severity, color = replicate))+\n  theme_r4pde()+\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")+\n  geom_point(size = 2)+\n  geom_line(size = 1)+\n  scale_color_grey()+\n  labs(x = \"Distance from the source (m)\",\n       y = \"Stripe rust severity (%)\",\n       color = \"Replicate\",\n       caption = \"source: Sackett et al.

Conversely, the decrease is less steep at greater distances, eventually reaching a point of either zero or a low background level with only occasional diseased plants.\n\nThe unique shapes of these gradients are largely influenced by mechanisms associated with the dispersal of the inoculum, which are contingent not only on the pathogen's biological characteristics but also heavily upon environmental factors that can impact the pathogen's dispersion.\n\nFrom this, we can categorize the resulting gradients into two types: primary and secondary. The primary gradient is generated solely from the initial source of the infection. On the other hand, the secondary gradient arises from the movement of inoculum that has been produced by plants previously infected due to the primary gradient. These secondary infections then spread to other plants situated at increasing distances from the initial source.\n\nAs the disease proliferates over time, it's expected that a combination of both primary and secondary gradients will manifest. This interplay between the two gradient types contributes to the overall spread and severity of the disease within a given population and environment.\n\nAs an example of primary and secondary gradients, let's visualize the gradients of Septoria leaf spot, caused by *Septoria lycopersici*, on tomato [@parker1997]. The gradients were measured during two times, thus enabling a comparison of primary and secondary dispersal/disease gradients.

In gradients, this is called a **focus** (where foci are deemed the plural), from where the inoculum originates. Three types of foci can be defined: point, line or area sources. While the point source can be a plant or group of plants at any position in the plot or field (center or corner), line and area sources are usually defined as one or more rows of diseased plants at one side of the plot or field.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nline <- ggplot(data.frame(c(1:10),c(1:10)))+\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 0, xmax = 10, ymin = 0, ymax = 10, fill = \"gray92\")+\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 0, xmax = 10, ymin = 9.7, ymax = 10, color = \"black\", fill = \"#339966\")+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 1, xend = 1, y = 9.5, yend = 2, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 3, xend = 3, y = 9.5, yend = 2, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 5, xend = 5, y = 9.5, yend = 2, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 7, xend = 7, y = 9.5, yend = 2, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 9, xend = 9, y = 9.5, yend = 2, arrow = arrow())+\n  ylim(0,10)+\n  xlim(0,10)+\n  coord_fixed()+\n  theme_void()+\n  labs(title = \"      Side line\")\n\narea <- ggplot(data.frame(c(1:10),c(1:10)))+\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 0, xmax = 10, ymin = 0, ymax = 10, fill = \"gray92\")+\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 0, xmax = 10, ymin = 8.2, ymax = 10, color = \"black\", fill = \"#339966\")+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 1, xend = 1, y = 8, yend = 2, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 3, xend = 3, y = 8, yend = 2, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 5, xend = 5, y = 8, yend = 2, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 7, xend = 7, y = 8, yend = 2, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 9, xend = 9, y = 8, yend = 2, arrow = arrow())+\n  ylim(0,10)+\n  xlim(0,10)+\n  coord_fixed()+\n  theme_void()+\n  labs(title = \"      Side area\")\n\npoint_central <- ggplot(data.frame(c(1:10),c(1:10)))+\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 0, xmax = 10, ymin = 0, ymax = 10, fill = \"gray92\")+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 5, xend = 10, y = 5, yend = 10, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 5, xend = 10, y = 5, yend = 5, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 5, xend = 10, y = 5, yend = 0, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 5, xend = 0, y = 5, yend = 0, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 5, xend = 0, y = 5, yend = 5, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 5, xend = 0, y = 5, yend = 10, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 5, xend = 5, y = 5, yend = 10, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 5, xend = 5, y = 5, yend = 0, arrow = arrow())+\n   annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 5.5, xmax = 4.5, ymin = 4.5, ymax = 5.5, color = \"black\", fill = \"#339966\" )+\n  ylim(0,10)+\n  xlim(0,10)+\n  coord_fixed()+\n  theme_void()+\n  labs(title = \"    Central point/area\")\n\npoint_corner <- ggplot(data.frame(c(1:10),c(1:10)))+\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 0, xmax = 10, ymin = 0, ymax = 10, fill = \"gray92\")+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 0, xend = 10, y = 10, yend = 0, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 0, xend = 6.6, y = 10, yend = 0, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 0, xend = 3.3, y = 10, yend = 0, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 0, xend = 0, y = 10, yend = 0, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 0, xend = 10, y = 10, yend = 3.3, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 0, xend = 10, y = 10, yend = 6.6, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"segment\", size = 2, x = 0, xend = 10, y = 10, yend = 10, arrow = arrow())+\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 0, xmax = 1, ymin = 9, ymax = 10, color = \"black\", fill = \"#339966\")+\n  ylim(0,10)+\n  xlim(0,10)+\n  coord_fixed()+\n  theme_void()+\n  labs(title = \"    Corner point/area\")\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\np_gradients <- (line | area)/\n(point_central | point_corner)\n\nggsave(\"imgs/gradients.png\", width =9, height =9, bg = \"white\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n![Example of location and size of inoculum sources for the study of disease gradients](imgs/gradients.png){#fig-gradient width=\"584\"}\n",
