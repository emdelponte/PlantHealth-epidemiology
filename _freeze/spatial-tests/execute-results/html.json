The choice of the methods depends on the question, the nature of the data and scale of observation. Usually, more than one test is applied for the same or different scales of interest depending on how the data are collected.\n\nThe several exploratory or inferential methods can be classified based on the spatial scale and type of data (binary, count, etc.) collected, but mainly if the spatial location of the unit is known (mapped) or not known (sampled). Following @madden2007, two major groups can be formed. The first group uses intensively mapped data for which the location \\[x,y\\] of the sampling unit is known. Examples of data include binary data (plant is infected or not infected) in planting row, point pattern (spatial arrangements of points in a 2-D space) and quadrat data (grids are superimposed on point pattern data). The second group is the sparsely sampled data in the form of count or proportion (incidence) data for which the location is not known or, if known, not taken into account in the analysis.\n\n![Classification of spatial data and methods used to study spatial patterns of plant disease based on knowledge of the location of the sampling units and nature of the data.](imgs/spatial_methods2.png){#fig-spatialmethods width=\"649\"}\n\n## Intensively mapped\n\n### Binary data\n\nIn this situation the individual plants are mapped, meaning that their relative positions to one another are known. It is the case when a census is used to map presence/absence data. The status of each unit (usually a plant) is noted as a binary variable. The plant is either diseased (D or 1) or non-diseased or healthy (H or 0). Several statistical tests can be used to detect a deviation from randomness. The most commonly used tests are runs, doublets and join count.\n\n#### Runs test\n\nA **run** is defined as a succession of *one or more* diseased (D) or healthy (H) plants, which are followed and preceded by a plant of the other disease status or no plant at all [@madden1982]. There would be few runs if there is an aggregation of diseased or healthy plants and a large number of runs for a random mixing of diseased and healthy plants.\n\nLet's create a vector of binary (0 = non-diseased; 1 = diseased) data representing a crop row with 32 plants and assign it to `y`. For plotting purposes, we make a data frame for more complete information.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) \n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny1 <- c(1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0)\nx1 <- c(1:32) # position of each plant\nz1 <- 1\nrow1 <- data.frame(x1, y1, z1) # create a dataframe\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can then visualize the series using ggplot and count the number of runs as 8, aided by the different colors used to identify a run.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(grid)\nruns2 <- row1 |>\n  ggplot(aes(x1, z1, label = x1, color = factor(y1))) +\n  geom_point(shape = 15, size = 10) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = max(z1)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"gray70\", \"darkred\")) +\n  geom_text(vjust = 0, nudge_y = 0.5) +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  ylim(0, 2.5) +\n  theme_void() +\n   theme(legend.position = \"top\")+\n  labs(color = \"Status\")\nggsave(\"imgs/runs2.png\", runs2, width = 12, height = 2, bg = \"white\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n![Sequence of diseased (dark red) or non-diseased (gray) units (plants).

The number of joins of the specified type in the orientation(s) of interest is then counted. The question is whether the observed join-count is large (or small) relative to that expected for a random pattern. The join-count statistics provides a basic measure of spatial autocorrelation. The expected number of join counts can defined under randomness and the corresponding standard errors can be estimated after constants are calculated based on the number of rows and columns of the matrix.\n\nLet's use the `join_count()` function of the {r4pde} package to perform a join count test. The formulations in this function apply only for a rectangular array with no missing values, with the \"rook\" definition of proximity, and they were all presented in the book The Study of Plant Disease Epidemics, page 261 [@chapter2007].\n\nLet's create a series of binary data from left to right and top to bottom. The data is displayed in Fig. 9.13 in page 260 of the book [@chapter2007]. In the example, there are 5 rows and 5 columns. This will be informed later to compose the matrix which is the data format for analysis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm1 <- c(1,0,1,1,0,\n       1,1,0,0,0,\n       1,0,1,0,0,\n       1,0,0,1,0,\n       0,1,0,1,1)\nmatrix1 <- matrix(m1, 5, 5, byrow = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can visualize the two-dimensional array by converting to a raster.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Convert to raster \nmapS2 <- terra::rast(matrix(matrix1, 5 , 5, byrow = TRUE))\n# Convert to data frame\nmapS3 <- terra::as.data.frame(mapS2, xy = TRUE)\nmapS3 |>\n  ggplot(aes(x, y, label = lyr.1, fill = factor(lyr.1))) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", linewidth = 0.5) +\n  theme_void() +\n  coord_fixed()+\n  labs(fill = \"Status\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray70\", \"darkred\"))+\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Visualization of a matrix of presence/absence data representing a disease spatial pattern](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/fig-joincount1-1.png){#fig-joincount1 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe function `join_count()` calculates spatial statistics for a matrix based on the specifications and calculations shown in the book [@chapter2007]. It identifies patterns of aggregation for values in a binary matrix based on join count statistics. The results determine whether the observed spatial arrangement is aggregated or non-aggregated (random) based on a standard normal distribution test statistic Z-score applied separately for HD or DD sequences. For HD, Z-score lower than - 1.64 (more negative) is taken as a basis for rejection of hypothesis of randomness (P = 0.05). For DD sequences, Z-score greater than 1.64 indicates aggregation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(r4pde)\njoin_count(matrix1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nJoin Count Analysis of Spatial Patterns of Plant Diseases:\n ----------------------------------------------------------\n 1) 'HD' Sequences:\n    - Observed Count: 23\n    - Expected Count : 19.97\n    - Standard Deviation: 3.17\n    - Z-score: 0.80\n The pattern for 'HD' sequences is 'not aggregated'.\n\n 2) 'DD' Sequences:\n    - Observed Count: 7\n    - Expected Count: 9.22\n    - Standard Deviation: 4.23\n    - Z-score: -0.41\n The pattern for 'DD' sequences is 'not aggregated'.\n ----------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the example above, the observed count of HD sequence was larger than the expected count, so the Z-score suggests non aggregation, or randomness. The DD sequence observed count was lower than expected count, confirming non aggregation. Let's repeat the procedure using the second array of data shown in the book chapter, for which the result is different. In this case, there is evidence of aggregation of diseased plants, because the observed DD is greater than expected and observed HD is lower than expected. The Z-score for HD is less than -1.64 (P\\< 0.05) and the Z-score for DD is greater than 1.64 (P \\< 0.05).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nm2 <- c(1,1,1,0,0,\n       1,1,1,0,0,\n       1,1,1,0,0,\n       1,1,1,0,0,\n       0,0,0,0,0)\nmatrix2 <- matrix(m2, 5, 5, byrow = TRUE)\n\njoin_count(matrix2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nJoin Count Analysis of Spatial Patterns of Plant Diseases:\n ----------------------------------------------------------\n 1) 'HD' Sequences:\n    - Observed Count: 7\n    - Expected Count : 19.97\n    - Standard Deviation: 3.17\n    - Z-score: -4.24\n The pattern for 'HD' sequences is 'aggregated'.\n\n 2) 'DD' Sequences:\n    - Observed Count: 17\n    - Expected Count: 9.22\n    - Standard Deviation: 4.23\n    - Z-score: 1.96\n The pattern for 'DD' sequences is 'aggregated'.\n ----------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can apply these tests for a real example epidemic data provided by the {r4pde} R package.

In its simplest form, one can visualize this as a scatter plot on a map, where each point represents an event, object, or entity in space. For example, the points might represent the locations of diseased plants in a population.\n\nThe easiest way to visualize a 2-D point pattern is to produce a map of the locations, which is simply a scatter plot but with the provision that the axes are equally scaled. However, while the visualization can provide a basic understanding of the spatial distribution, the real power of point pattern analysis lies in the quantitative methods that allow one to analyze the distribution in a more detailed and systematic way. These methods help to identify whether the points are randomly distributed, clustered (points are closer together than expected by chance), or regularly spaced (points are more evenly spaced than expected by chance). This analysis can provide insights into underlying processes that might explain the observed patterns.\n\nLet's work with two simulated datasets that were originally generated to produced a random or an aggregated (clustered) pattern.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(r4pde)\nrand <- SpatialRandom\naggr <- SpatialAggregated\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's produce 2-D map for each data frame.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprand <- rand |> \n  ggplot(aes(x, y))+\n  geom_point()+\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"black\", NA))+\n  coord_fixed()+\n  coord_flip()+\n   theme_r4pde(font_size = 12)+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")+\n  labs (title = \"Random\", \n        x = \"Latitude\",\n        y = \"Longitude\",\n        caption = \"Source: r4pd R package\")\n\npaggr <- aggr |> \n  ggplot(aes(x, y))+\n  geom_point()+\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"black\", NA))+\n  coord_fixed()+\n  coord_flip()+\n  theme_r4pde(font_size = 12)+\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")+\n  labs (title = \"Aggregated\", \n        x = \"Latitude\",\n        y = \"Longitude\",\n        caption = \"Source: r4pd R package\")\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\nprand | paggr\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Quadrat count\n\nIn the Quadrat Count method, the study region is divided into a regular grid of smaller, equally-sized rectangular or square subregions known as quadrats. For each quadrat, the number of points falling inside it is counted. If the points are uniformly and independently distributed across the region (i.e., random), then the number of points in each quadrat should follow a Poisson distribution. If the variance of the counts is roughly equal to the mean of the counts, then the pattern is considered to be random. If the variance is greater than the mean, it suggests that the pattern is aggregated or clumped.\n\nUsing the {spatstats} package, we first need to create a ppp object which represents a point pattern. This is the primary object type in spatstat for point patterns.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(spatstat)\n\n### Create rectangular window around the points\nwindow_rand <- bounding.box.xy(rand$x, rand$y)\n\n# create the point pattern object\nppp_rand <- ppp(rand$x, rand$y, window_rand)\nplot(ppp_rand)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUsing the `quadratcount` function, we can divide the study region into a grid and count the number of points in each cell:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Quadrat count 8 x 8\nqq <- quadratcount(ppp_rand,8,8, keepempty = TRUE) \n\n# plot the quadrat count\nplot(qq)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo determine whether the observed distribution of points is consistent with a random Poisson process, we can use the`quadrat.test` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Quadrat test\nqt <- quadrat.test(qq, alternative=\"clustered\", method=\"M\")\nqt\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tConditional Monte Carlo test of CSR using quadrat counts\n\tTest statistic: Pearson X2 statistic\n\ndata:  \nX2 = 47.04, p-value = 0.9375\nalternative hypothesis: clustered\n\nQuadrats: 8 by 8 grid of tiles\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe result will give a Chi-squared statistic and a p-value. If the p-value is very low, then the pattern is likely not random. Keep in mind that the choice of the number and size of quadrats can affect the results.

Essentially, this means that it helps in determining whether a set of spatial points is distributed randomly or if there is some underlying pattern or interaction.\n\nHowever, unlike other goodness-of-fit tests in the spatial context, the Spatial KS Test leverages the values of a spatial covariate at the observed data points and contrasts them against the expected distribution of the same covariate under the assumption of CSR. The idea behind this test is to check if there's any difference between the observed distribution of a spatial covariate's values and the expected distribution if the points were distributed in a completely spatial random fashion.\n\nKey points of the test are:\n\n-   **Covariate**: For this test, a spatial covariate must be chosen. This is a spatially varying feature or value that might influence the point process. Examples include elevation, soil quality, or distance from a specific feature. The distribution of this covariate's values at the observed data points is the crux of the test.\n\n-   **Comparison with CSR**: The observed distribution of the spatial covariate's values at the data points is juxtaposed with what would be expected under the CSR model. The CSR model posits that points are distributed purely by chance, without any underlying structure or influence.\n\n-   **Methodology**: The test employs a classical goodness-of-fit approach to contrast the observed and expected distributions. Specifically, it utilizes the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, a non-parametric measure to gauge the similarity between two distributions.\n\nAs example, we may want to select spatial coordinates themselves (like **`x`**, **`y`**, or both) as the covariates. This means the test will assess how the observed distribution of x-coordinates (or y-coordinates or both) of the data points compares to what would be anticipated under CSR.\n\nLet's test for the aggregated data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# y as covariate\nks_y <- cdf.test(ppp_aggr, test=\"ks\", \"y\", jitter=FALSE)\nks_y\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tSpatial Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of CSR in two dimensions\n\ndata:  covariate 'y' evaluated at points of 'ppp_aggr' \n     and transformed to uniform distribution under CSR\nD = 0.070995, p-value = 0.2453\nalternative hypothesis: two-sided\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(ks_y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# x as covariate\nks_x <- cdf.test(ppp_aggr, test=\"ks\", \"x\", jitter=FALSE)\nks_x\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tSpatial Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of CSR in two dimensions\n\ndata:  covariate 'x' evaluated at points of 'ppp_aggr' \n     and transformed to uniform distribution under CSR\nD = 0.093863, p-value = 0.0512\nalternative hypothesis: two-sided\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(ks_x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# x and y as covariates\nfun <- function(x,y){2* x + y}\nks_xy <- cdf.test(ppp_aggr, test=\"ks\", fun, jitter=FALSE)\nks_xy\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tSpatial Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of CSR in two dimensions\n\ndata:  covariate 'fun' evaluated at points of 'ppp_aggr' \n     and transformed to uniform distribution under CSR\nD = 0.12687, p-value = 0.002471\nalternative hypothesis: two-sided\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(ks_xy)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs shown above, we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of complete spatial randomness.\n\n#### Distance based\n\n##### Ripley's K\n\nA spatial point process is a set of irregularly distributed locations within a defined region which are assumed to have been generated by some form of stochastic mechanism. The **K function**, a.k.a. Ripley's K-function, is a statistical measure used in spatial analysis to examine the spatial distribution of a single type of point in a given area. Named after its developer, the British statistician B.D. Ripley, the K-function measures the expected number of points within a given distance of an arbitrary point, assuming homogeneous intensity (a constant probability of a point occurring in a particular place).\n\nTo describe it simply: imagine you have a map of diseased trees in a forest, and you select a tree at random. The K-function helps you answer the question: \"How many other diseased trees do I expect to find within a certain distance from the diseased tree I've chosen?\"\n\nThe K-function is often used to identify and analyze patterns within spatial data, such as clustering, randomness, or regularity (dispersion). It is particularly useful because it looks at the distribution at all scales (distances) simultaneously. To interpret the results of Ripley's K-function:\n\n1.  **Random distribution**: If the points (like trees in our example) are randomly distributed, the plot of the K-function will be a straight line at a 45-degree angle.\n\n2.  **Clustered distribution**: If the points are clustered (grouped closer together than you'd expect by chance), the plot will be above the 45-degree line of the random expectation.\n\n3.  **Regular or dispersed distribution**: If the points are regularly spaced or dispersed (further apart than you'd expect by chance), the plot will be below the 45-degree line.\n\nRipley's K checks the density of diseased units in each area by the variance as a function of radial distances (*r*) from the diseased unit, hence *K(r)*. If the spatial localization of a diseased unit is independent, the process is random in space.\n\nLet's use the `Kest` function of the spatstat package to obtain *K(r)*.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nk_rand <- Kest(ppp_rand)\nplot(k_rand)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nk_aggr <- Kest(ppp_aggr)\nplot(k_aggr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `envelope` function performs simulations and computes envelopes of a summary statistic based on the simulations. The envelope can be used to assess the goodness-of-fit of a point process model to point pattern data [@baddeley2014]. Let's simulate the envelope and plot the values using ggplot.

The name derives from the method of placing a series of concentric circles (O-rings) around each point of type 1 and counting how many points of type 2 fall within each ring. The plot generated by O-ring statistics is called an O-ring plot or an O-function plot. It plots the radius of the rings on the x-axis and the estimated intensity of points of type 2 around points of type 1 on the y-axis.\n\nInterpreting the plot is as follows:\n\n1.  **Random pattern**: If points of type 2 are randomly distributed around points of type 1, the O-ring plot will be a flat line. This means that the intensity of points of type 2 does not change with the distance to points of type 1.\n\n2.  **Aggregation or clustering**: If points of type 2 are aggregated around points of type 1, the O-ring plot will be an upward-sloping curve. This indicates that the intensity of points of type 2 increases with proximity to points of type 1.\n\n3.  **Dispersion**: If points of type 2 are dispersed away from points of type 1, the O-ring plot will be a downward-sloping curve. This shows that the intensity of points of type 2 decreases as you get closer to points of type 1.\n\nThe O-ring plot often includes a confidence envelope. If the O-ring statistic falls within this envelope, it suggests that the observed pattern could be the result of random spatial processes. If it falls outside the envelope, it suggests that the pattern is not random. Therefore, to decide whether a pattern is aggregated or random using O-ring statistics:\n\n-   Look at the shape of the O-ring plot.\n\n-   Compare the O-ring statistic to the confidence envelope.\n\nAn aggregated pattern will show an increasing curve that lies outside the confidence envelope, indicating that the density of type 2 points is higher close to type 1 points. On the other hand, a random pattern will show a flat line that lies within the confidence envelope, indicating no significant difference in the density of type 2 points around type 1 points at varying distances.\n\nIn R, we can use the `estimate_o_ring()` function of the *onpoint* package. We will use the point pattern object `ppp_fw` used in the previous examples\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(onpoint)\nplot(estimate_o_ring(ppp_rand))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(estimate_o_ring(ppp_aggr))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe function can be used in combination with `spatstat`'s `envelope()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noring_envelope <- envelope(ppp_aggr, fun = estimate_o_ring, nsim = 199, verbose = FALSE)\nplot(oring_envelope)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo plot simulation envelopes using quantum plots [@esser2014], just pass an `envelope` object as input to [`plot_quantums()`](https://r-spatialecology.github.io/onpoint/reference/plot_quantums.html).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_quantums(oring_envelope, ylab = \"O-ring\")+\n  theme_r4pde()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Grouped data\n\nIf the data are intensively mapped, meaning that the spatial locations of the sampling units are known, we are not limited to analyse presence/absence (incidence) only data at the unit level. The sampling units may be quadrats where the total number of plants and the number of disease plants (or number of pathogen propagules) are known. Alternatively, it could be a continuous measure of severity. The question here, similar to the previous section, is whether a plant being diseased makes it more (or less) likely that neighboring plants will be diseased. If that is the case, diseased plants are exhibiting spatial autocorrelation. The most common methods are:\n\n-   Autocorrelation (known as Moran's I)\n\n-   Semivariance\n\n-   SADIE (an alternative approach to autocorrelation.)\n\n#### Autocorrelation\n\nSpatial autocorrelation analysis provides a quantitative assessment of whether a large value of disease intensity in a sampling unit makes it more (positive autocorrelation) or less (negative auto- correlation) likely that neighboring sampling units tend to have a large value of disease intensity [@chapter2007].\n\nWe will illustrate the basic concept by reproducing the example provided in page 264 of the chapter on spatial analysis [@chapter2007], which was extracted from table 11.3 of @Campbell1990. The data represent a single transect with the number of *Macrophomia phaseolina* propagules per 10 g air-dry soil recorded in 16 contiguous quadrats across a field.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmp <- data.frame(\n  i = c(1:16),\n  y = c(41, 60, 81, 22, 8, 20, 28, 2, 0, 2, 2, 8, 0, 43, 61, 50)\n)\nmp\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n    i  y\n1   1 41\n2   2 60\n3   3 81\n4   4 22\n5   5  8\n6   6 20\n7   7 28\n8   8  2\n9   9  0\n10 10  2\n11 11  2\n12 12  8\n13 13  0\n14 14 43\n15 15 61\n16 16 50\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can produce a plot to visualize the number of propagules across the transect.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmp |>\n  ggplot(aes(i, y)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"darkred\") +\n  theme_r4pde()+\n  labs(\n    x = \"Relative position within a transect\",\n    y = \"Number of propagules\",\n    caption = \"Source: Campbell and Madden (1990)\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Number of propagules of Macrophomina phaseolina in the soil at various positions within a transect](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/fig-macrophomina-1.png){#fig-macrophomina width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo calculate the autocorrelation coefficient in R, we can use the `ac()` function of the *tseries* package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tseries)\nac_mp <- acf(mp$y, lag = 5, pl = FALSE)\nac_mp\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nAutocorrelations of series 'mp$y', by lag\n\n     0      1      2      3      4      5 \n 1.000  0.586  0.126 -0.033 -0.017 -0.181 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's store the results in a data frame to facilitate visualization.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nac_mp_dat <- data.frame(index = ac_mp$lag, ac_mp$acf)\nac_mp_dat\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  index   ac_mp.acf\n1     0  1.00000000\n2     1  0.58579374\n3     2  0.12636306\n4     3 -0.03307249\n5     4 -0.01701392\n6     5 -0.18092810\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd now the plot known as autocorrelogram.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nac_mp_dat |>\n  ggplot(aes(index, ac_mp.acf, label = round(ac_mp.acf, 3))) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"darkred\") +\n  theme_r4pde()+\n  geom_text(vjust = 0, nudge_y = 0.05) +\n  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 6) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +\n  labs(x = \"Distance lag\", y = \"Autocorrelation coefficient\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Autocorrelogram for the spatial distribution of Macrophomina phaseolina in soil](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/fig-autocorrel-1.png){#fig-autocorrel width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe values we obtained here are not the same but quite close to the values reported in @madden2007. For the transect data, the calculated coefficients in the book example for lags 1, 2 and 3 are 0.625, 0.144, and - 0.041. The conclusion is the same, the smaller the distance between sampling units, the stronger is the correlation between the count values.\n\n##### Moran's I\n\nThe method above is usually referred to Moran's I [@Moran1950], a widely-used statistic to measure spatial autocorrelation in spatial datasets. The presence of spatial autocorrelation implies that nearby locations exhibit more similar (positive autocorrelation) or dissimilar (negative autocorrelation) values than would be expected under random arrangements.\n\nLet's use another example dataset from the book to calculate the Moran's I in R. The data is shown in page 269 of the book. The data represent the number of diseased plants per quadrat (out of a total of 100 plants in each) in 144 quadrats. It was based on an epidemic generated using the stochastic simulator of @xu2004. The data is stored in a CSV file.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nepi <- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emdelponte/epidemiology-R/main/data/xu-madden-simulated.csv\")\nepi1 <- epi |>\n  pivot_longer(2:13,\n               names_to = \"y\",\n               values_to = \"n\") |>\n  pull(n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe {spdep} package in R provides a suite of functions for handling spatial dependence in data, and one of its main functions for assessing spatial autocorrelation is **`moran()`**. The **`moran()`** function calculates Moran's I statistic for a given dataset. It requires two primary inputs: 1) A **Numeric Vector**: This vector represents the values for which spatial autocorrelation is to be measured. Typically, this could be a variable like population density, temperature, or any other spatial attribute; and 2) A **Spatial Weights Matrix**: This matrix represents the spatial relationships between the observations. It can be thought of as defining the \"neighbors\" for each observation. The {spdep} package provides functions to create various types of spatial weights, such as contiguity-based weights or distance-based weights. Let's load the library and start with the procedures.\\\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(100)\nlibrary(spdep)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `cell2nb()` function creates the neighbor list with 12 rows and 12 columns, which is how the 144 quadrats are arranged.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnb <- cell2nb(12, 12, type = \"queen\", torus = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `nb2listw()` function supplements a neighbors list with spatial weights for the chosen coding scheme. We use the default W, which is the row standardized (sums over all links to n). We then create the `col.W` neighbor list.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncol.W <- nb2listw(nb, style = \"W\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe Moran's I statistic is given by the `moran()` function\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmoran(x = epi1, # numeric vector\n      listw = col.W, # the nb list\n      n = 12, # number of zones\n      S0 = Szero(col.W)) # global sum of weights\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n$I\n[1] 0.05818595\n\n$K\n[1] 2.878088\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `$I` is Moran's I and `$K` output is the sample kurtosis of x, or a measure of the \"tailedness\" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable.\n\nThe interpretations for Moran's I is as follows: A positive Moran's I indicates positive spatial autocorrelation. Nearby locations tend to have similar values, while a Negative Moran's I suggests negative spatial autocorrelation. Neighboring locations have dissimilar values. Moran's close to zero indicates no spatial autocorrelation. The distribution appears random.\n\nIn the context of Moran's I and spatial statistics, kurtosis of the data (**`x`**) can provide additional insights. For instance, if the data is leptokurtic (`$K` \\> 3), it might suggest that there are some hotspots or cold spots (clusters of high or low values) in the spatial dataset. On the other hand, platykurtic (`$K` \\< 3) data might indicate a more even spread without pronounced clusters. This information can be useful when interpreting the results of spatial autocorrelation tests and in understanding the underlying spatial structures.\n\n##### Moran's test\n\nThe Moran's I test is a cornerstone of spatial statistics, used to detect spatial autocorrelation in data. In the realm of the **`spdep`** package in R, the **`moran.test()`** function is employed to perform this test. The Moran's test for spatial autocorrelation uses spatial weights matrix in weights list form. The key inputs are:\n\n-   **x**: This is a numeric vector containing the values we wish to test for spatial autocorrelation. It could be anything like population densities, number of diseased unites or severity, in the context of plant disease.\n\n-   **listw**: This represents the spatial weights, and it's in list form. The spatial weights matrix is essential for the Moran's test because it defines the \"relationship\" between different observations. How we define these relationships can vary: it might be based on distance (e.g., closer observations have higher weights), contiguity (e.g., observations that share a border), or other criteria.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmoran.test(x = epi1, \n           listw = col.W)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tMoran I test under randomisation\n\ndata:  epi1  \nweights: col.W    \n\nMoran I statistic standard deviate = 15.919, p-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: greater\nsample estimates:\nMoran I statistic       Expectation          Variance \n      0.698231416      -0.006993007       0.001962596 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe function will return the Moran's I statistic value, an expected value under the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation, the variance, and a p-value. The p-value can be used to determine the statistical significance of the observed Moran's I value. The interpretation is as follows:\n\n-   A significant **positive Moran's I value** indicates positive spatial autocorrelation, meaning that similar values cluster together in the spatial dataset.\n\n-   A significant **negative Moran's I value** suggests negative spatial autocorrelation, implying that dissimilar values are adjacent to one another.\n\n-   If Moran's I is not statistically significant (based on the p-value), it suggests that the spatial pattern might be random, and there's no evidence of spatial autocorrelation.\n\nIn conclusion, the **`moran.test()`** function offers a structured way to investigate spatial autocorrelation in datasets. Spatial weights play a crucial role in this analysis, representing the spatial relationships between observations.\n\nAs before, we can construct a correlogram using the output of the `sp.correlogram()` function. Note that the figure below is very similar to the one shown in Figure 91.5 in page 269 of the book chapter [@chapter2007].

This differs from spatial autocorrelation because distances are usually measured in discrete spatial lags. The semi-variance can be defined as half the variance of the differences between all possible points spaced a constant distance apart.\n\nThe semi-variance at a distance d = 0 will be zero, because there are no differences between points that are compared to themselves. However, as points are compared to increasingly distant points, the semi-variance increases. At some distance, called the *Range*, the semi-variance will become approximately equal to the variance of the whole surface itself. This is the greatest distance over which the value at a point on the surface is related to the value at another point. In fact, when the distance between two sampling units is small, the sampling units are close together and, usually, variability is low. As the distance increases, so (usually) does the variability.\n\nResults of semi-variance analysis are normally presented as a graphical plot of semi-variance against distance, which is referred to as a semi-variogram. The main characteristics of the semi-variogram of interest are the nugget, the range and the sill, and their estimations are usually based on an appropriate (non-linear) model fitted to the data points representing the semi-variogram.\n\nFor the semi-variance, we will use the `variog()` function of the *geoR* package. We need the data in the long format (x, y and z). Let's reshape the data to the long format and store it in `epi2` dataframe.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nepi2 <- epi |>\n  pivot_longer(2:13,\n               names_to = \"y\",\n               values_to = \"n\") |>\n  mutate(y = as.numeric(y))\n\nhead(epi2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n      x     y     n\n  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1     1     1     2\n2     1     2     2\n3     1     3     3\n4     1     4    33\n5     1     5     4\n6     1     6     0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(geoR)\n# the coordinates are x and y and the data is the n\nv1 <- variog(coords = epi2[,1:2], data = epi2[,3])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nvariog: computing omnidirectional variogram\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nv2 <- variofit(v1, ini.cov.pars = c(1200, 12), \n               cov.model = \"exponential\", \n               fix.nugget = F)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nvariofit: covariance model used is exponential \nvariofit: weights used: npairs \nvariofit: minimisation function used: optim \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plotting \nplot(v1, xlim = c(0,15))\nlines(v2, lty = 1, lwd = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Semivariance plot for the spatial distribution simulated epidemic](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/fig-semivariance-1.png){#fig-semivariance width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### SADIE\n\nSADIE (spatial analysis by distance indices) is an alternative to autocorrelation and semi-variance methods described previously, which has found use in plant pathology [@chapter2007; @xu2004; @li2011]. Similar to those methods, the spatial coordinates for the disease intensity (count of diseased individuals) or pathogen propagules values should be provided.\n\nSADIE quantifies spatial pattern by calculating the minimum total distance to regularity. That is, the distance that individuals must be moved from the starting point defined by the observed counts to the end point at which there is the same number of individuals in each sampling unit. Therefore, if the data are highly aggregated, the distance to regularity will be large, but if the data are close to regular to start with, the distance to regularity will be smaller.\n\nThe null hypothesis to test is that the observed pattern is random. SADIE calculates an index of aggregation (*Ia*). When this is equal to 1, the pattern is random. If this is greater than 1, the pattern is aggregated. Hypothesis testing is based on the randomization procedure. The null hypothesis of randomness, with an alternative hypothesis of aggregation.\n\nAn extension was made to quantify the contribution of each sampling unit count to the observed pattern. Regions with large counts are defined as patches and regions with small counts are defined as gaps. For each sampling unit, a clustering index is calculated and can be mapped.\n\nIn R, we can use the `sadie()` function of the *epiphy* package [@gigot2018]. The function computes the different indices and probabilities based on the distance to regularity for the observed spatial pattern and a specified number of random permutations of this pattern. To run the analysis, the dataframe should have only three columns: the first two must be the x and y coordinates and the third one the observations. Let's continue working with the simulated epidemic dataset named `epi2`. We can map the original data as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nepi2 |>\n  ggplot(aes(x, y, label = n, fill = n)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  geom_text(size = 5, color = \"white\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"gray70\", high = \"darkred\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Spatial map for the number of diseased plants per quadrat (n = 144) in simulated epidemic](spatial-tests_files/figure-html/fig-mapgrouped-1.png){#fig-mapgrouped width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(epiphy)\nsadie_epi2 <- sadie(epi2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nComputation of Perry's indices:\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsadie_epi2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nSpatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs (sadie)\n\nCall:\nsadie.data.frame(data = epi2)\n\nIa: 2.4622 (Pa = < 2.22e-16)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe simple output shows the *Ia* value and associated *P*-value.

While the latter provides intricate details about the spatial location of each unit, sparsely sampled data lacks this granularity. This absence means that the spatial location of individual units isn't factored into the analysis of sparsely sampled data.\n\nIn the realm of analyzing such data, particularly in understanding disease intensity, researchers often aim to characterize the range of variability in the average level of disease intensity for each sampling unit, as indicated by [@chapter2007]. The methodology to analyze sparsely sampled data, especially in relation to the spatial patterns seen in plant disease epidemics, can be broadly categorized into two primary approaches:\n\n1.  **Goodness of Fit to Statistical Distributions**: This approach focuses on testing how well the observed data matches expected statistical probability distributions. By doing so, researchers can assess the likelihood that the observed data is a good fit for a particular statistical model or distribution.\n\n2.  **Indices of Aggregation Calculation**: This involves computing various metrics that can help determine the degree to which data points, or disease incidents in this case, tend to cluster or aggregate in certain areas or patterns.\n\nFurthermore, the choice of analysis method often hinges on the nature of the data in question. For instance, data can either be in the form of raw counts or as incidences (proportions). Depending on this distinction, specific statistical distributions are presumed to best represent and describe the data. Subsequent sections will delve deeper into these methods, distinguishing between count and incidence data to provide clarity on the best analytical approach for each type.\n\n### Count data\n\n#### Fit to distributions\n\nTwo statistical distributions can be adopted as reference for the description of random or aggregated patterns of disease data in the form of counts of infection within sampling units. Take the count of lesions on a leaf, or the count of diseased plants on a quadrat, as an example. If the presence of a lesion/diseased plant does not increase or decrease the chance that other lesions/diseased plants will occur, the *Poisson* distribution describes the distribution of lesions on the leaf. Otherwise, the *negative binomial* provides a better description.\n\nLet's work with the previous simulation data of 144 quadrats with a variable count of diseased plants per quadrat (in a maximum of 100). Notice that we won't consider the location of each quadrat as in the previous analyses of intensively mapped data. We only need the vector with the number of infected units per sampling unit.\n\nThe *epiphy* package provides a function called `fit_two_distr()`, which allows fitting these two distribution for count data. In this case, either randomness assumption (Poisson distributions) or aggregation assumption (negative binomial) are made, and then, a goodness-of-fit comparison of both distributions is performed using a log-likelihood ratio test. The function requires a data frame created using the `count()` function where the number of infection units is designated as `i`. It won't work with a single vector of numbers. We create the data frame using:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata_count <- epi2 |> \n  mutate(i = n) |>  # create i vector\n  epiphy::count()   # create the map object of count class\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can now run the function that will look fo the the vector `i`. The function returns a list of four components including the outputs of the fitting process for both distribution and the result of the log-likelihood ratio test, the `llr`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfit_data_count <- fit_two_distr(data_count)\nsummary(fit_data_count)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nFitting of two distributions by maximum likelihood\nfor 'count' data.\nParameter estimates:\n\n(1) Poisson (random):\n       Estimate  Std.Err Z value    Pr(>z)    \nlambda 27.85417  0.43981  63.333 < 2.2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n(2) Negative binomial (aggregated):\n       Estimate    Std.Err Z value    Pr(>z)    \nk     0.6327452  0.0707846  8.9390 < 2.2e-16 ***\nmu   27.8541667  2.9510202  9.4388 < 2.2e-16 ***\nprob  0.0222118  0.0033463  6.6378 3.184e-11 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfit_data_count$llr\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nLikelihood ratio test\n\n               LogLik Df  Chisq Pr(>Chisq)    \nrandom :     -2654.71                         \naggregated :  -616.51  1 4076.4  < 2.2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe very low value of the *P*-value of the LLR test suggest that the negative binomial provides a better fit to the data.

The BPL is particularly useful for understanding spatial heterogeneity and overdispersion in plant disease incidence data [@chapter2007]. The year 2017 marked the 25th anniversary of the introduction of the Binary Power Law by Hughes and Madden - over the past quarter-century, the BPL has been widely adopted and extensively cited in the field of plant pathology [@Madden2018]. The BPL provides a robust framework for analyzing and interpreting spatial patterns in plant pathology data. By comparing observed variance to binomial variance, researchers can infer the degree and nature of overdispersion in plant disease incidence.\n\nThe BPL relates two variances:\n\n-   Observed Variance (V): $V = \\text{var}[X] = E[(X - np)^2]$\n\n-   Expected Binomial Variance (V~bin~): $V_{bin} = np(1 - p)$\n\nFor proportions:\n\n-   Observed Variance (v): $v = \\text{var}[x] = E[(x - p)^2]$\n\n-   Expected Binomial Variance (v\\_~bin~): $v_{bin} = \\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}$\n\nThe binomial distribution assumes independent observations of $X$, often interpreted as a random spatial pattern. If $X$ follows a binomial distribution, then $\\beta = 1$ in the BPL equations. Deviations from this indicate spatial heterogeneity or overdispersion. The log-log transformationis often used in statistical analyses due to the linear relationship between the log-transformed variables. Interpretation is as follows: when $\\beta = 1$: Spatial heterogeneity is constant, indicating fixed overdispersion; when $\\beta > 1$: Overdispersion varies systematically with incidence, showing a change in spatial heterogeneity with disease incidence levels. In practice, researchers fit the log-log model to empirical data to estimate $\\beta$ and $A_p$. This involves ordinary least squares (OLS) regression:\n\n$$\n\\ln(v_j) = \\ln(A_p) + \\beta \\ln\\left[\\frac{\\hat{p}_j(1 - \\hat{p}_j)}{n_j}\\right] + \\epsilon_j\n$$\n\nwhere: - $j$ refers to specific observations, - $\\hat{p}$ is the estimated proportion, - $\\epsilon_j$ is the residual error.\n\nThe intercept of the fitted model ($\\ln(A_p)$) provides the scale parameter, and the slope ($\\beta$) gives insight into the nature of spatial heterogeneity and overdispersion in the data.\n",
