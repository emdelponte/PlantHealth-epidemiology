## Introduction

Remote sensing techniques, in the sense of gathering & processing of data by a device separated from the object under study, are increasingly providing an important component of the set of technologies available for the study of vegetation systems and their functioning. This is in spite that many applications only provide indirect estimations of the biophysical variables of interest [@jones2010remote].

Particular advantages of remote sensing for vegetation studies are that: (i) it is non-contact and non-destructive; and (ii) observations are easily extrapolated to larger scales. Even at the plant scale, remotely sensed imagery is advantageous as it allows rapid sampling of large number of plants [@jones2010remote].

This chapter aims at providing a conceptual & practical approach to apply remote sensing data and techniques to infer information useful for monitoring crop diseases. The structure of this chapter is divided into four sections. The first one introduces basic remote sensing concepts and provides a summary of applications of remote sensing of crop diseases. The second one illustrates a case study focused on identification of banana Fusarium wilt from multispectral UAV imagery. The third one illustrates a case study dealing with estimation of cercospora leaf spot disease on table beet. Finally, it concludes with several reflections about potential and limitations of this technology.

## Remote sensing background

### Optical remote sensing

Optical remote sensing makes use of the radiation reflected by a surface in the visible (\~400-700 nm), the near infrared (700-1300 nm) and shortwave infrared (1300-\~3000 nm) parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Spaceborne & airborne-based remote sensing and field spectroscopy utilize the solar radiation as an illumination source. Lab spectroscopy utilizes a lamp as an artificial illumination source [@fig-RS1].

The proportion of the radiation reflected by a surface depends on the surface’s spectral reflection, absorption and transmission properties and varies with wavelength [@fig-RS2]. These spectral properties in turn depend on the surface’s physical and chemical constituents [@fig-RS2]. Measuring the reflected radiation hence allows us to draw conclusions on a surface’s characteristic, which is the basic principle behind optical remote sensing.

### Vegetation spectral properties

Optical remote sensing enables the deduction of various vegetation-related characteristics, including biochemical properties (e.g., pigments, water content), structural properties (e.g., leaf area index (LAI), biomass) or process properties (e.g., light use efficiency (LUE)). The ability to deduce these characteristics depends on the ability of a sensor to resolve vegetation spectra. Hyperspectral sensors capture spectral information in hundreds of narrow and contiguous bands in the VIS, NIR and SWIR, and, thus, resolve subtle absorption features caused by specific vegetation constituents (e.g. anthocyanins, carotenoids, lignin, cellulose, proteins). In contrast, multispectral sensors capture spectral information in a few broad spectral bands and, thus, only resolve broader spectral features. Still, multispectral systems like Sentinel-2 have been demonstrated to be useful to derive valuable vegetation properties (e.g., LAI, chlorophyll).

### What measures a remote sensor?

Optical sensors/spectrometers measure the radiation reflected by a surface to a certain solid angle in the physical quantity radiance. The unit of radiance is watts per square meter per steradian (W • m-2 • sr-1) [@fig-RS4]. In other words, radiance describes the amount of energy (W) that is reflected from a surface (m-2) and arrives at the sensor in a three-dimensional angle (sr-1).

![Source: https://pages.cms.hu-berlin.de/EOL/geo_rs/](imgs/RS-4.png){#fig-RS4 fig-align="center" width="428"}

A general problem related to the use of radiance as unit of measurement is the variation of radiance values with illumination. For example, the absolute incoming solar radiation varies over the course of the day as a function of the relative position between sun and surface and so does the absolute amount of radiance measured. We can only compare measurements taken a few hours apart or on different dates when we are putting the measured radiance in relation to the incoming illumination.

The quotient between measured reflected radiance and measured incoming radiance (Radiance~reflected~ / Radiance~incoming~) is called reflectance (usually denoted as $\rho$). Reflectance provides a stable unit of measurement which is independent from illumination and is the percentage of the total measurable radiation, which has not been absorbed or transmitted.

### Hyperspectral vs.multispectral imagery

Hyperspectral imaging involves capturing and analyzing data from a large number of narrow, contiguous bands across the electromagnetic spectrum, resulting in a high-resolution spectrum for each pixel in the image. As a result, a hyperspectral camera provides smooth spectra. The spectra provided by multispectral cameras are more like stairs or saw teeth without the ability to depict acute spectral signatures [@fig-RS8].

### Vegetation Indices

A vegetation index (VI) represents a spectral transformation of two or more bands of spectral imagery into a singleband image. A VI is designed to enhance the vegetation signal with regard to different vegetation properties, while minimizing confounding factors such as soil background reflectance, directional, or atmospheric effects. There are many different VIs, including multispectral broadband indices as well as hyperspectral narrowband indices.

Most of the multispectral broadband indices make use of the inverse relationship between the lower reflectance in the red (through chlorophyll absorption) and higher reflectance in the near-infrared (through leaf structure) to provide a measure of greenness that can be indirectly related to biochemical or structural vegetation properties (e.g., chlorophyll content, LAI). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is one of the most commonly used broadband VIs:

$$NDVI = \frac{\rho_{nir} - \rho_{red} }{\rho_{nir} + \rho_{red}}$$

The interpretation of the absolute value of the NDVI is highly informative, as it allows the immediate recognition of the areas of the farm or field that have problems. The NDVI is a simple index to interpret: its values vary between -1 and 1, and each value corresponds to a different agronomic situation, regardless of the crop [@fig-RS6]

## Remote sensing of crop diseases

### Detection of plant stress

One popular use of remote sensing is in diagnosis and monitoring of plant *responses* to biotic (i.e. disease and insect damage) and abiotic stress (e.g. water stress, heat, high light, pollutants) with hundreds of publications on the topic. It is worth nothing that most available techniques monitor the plant *response* rather than the stress itself. For example, with some diseases, it is common to estimate changes in canopy cover (using vegetation indices) as measures of "disease" but this measure could also be associated to water deficit [@jones2010remote]. This highlights the importance of measuring crop conditions in the field & laboratory to collect reliable data and be able to disentangle complex plant responses. Anyway, remote sensing can be used as the first step in site-specific disease control and also to phenotype the reactions of plant genotypes to pathogen attack [@lowe2017].

### Optical methods for measuring crop disease

There are a variety of optical sensors for the assessment of plant diseases. Sensors can be based only on the visible spectrum (400-700 nm) or on the visible and/or infrared spectrum (700 nm - 1mm). The latter may include near-infrared (NIR) (0.75-1.4 $μm$), short wavelength infrared (SWIR) (1.4–3 $μm$), medium wavelength infrared (MWIR) (3-8 $μm$), or thermal infrared (8-15 $μm$) [@fig-RS8]. Sensors record either imaging or non imaging (i.e average) spectral radiance values which need to be converted to reflectance before conducting any crop disease monitoring task.

In a recent chapter of Agrio's Plant Pathology, @delponte2024 highlights the importance of understanding the basic principles of the interaction of light with plant tissue or the plant canopy as a crucial prerrequisite for the analysis and interpretation for disease assessment. When a plant is infected, there are changes to the phisiology and biochemistry of the host, with the eventual development of disease symptoms and/or signs of the pathogen which may be accompanied by structural and biochemical changes that affect absorbance, transmittance, and reflectance of light [@fig-RS10].

### Scopes of disease sensing

The quantification of typical disease symptoms (disease severity) and assessment of leaves infected by several pathogens are relatively simple for imaging systems but may become a challenge for nonimaging sensors and sensors with inadequate spatial resolution [@oerke2020].

### Monitoring plant diseases

Sensing of plants for precision disease control is done in large fields or greenhouses where the aim is to detect the occurrence of diseases at the early stages of epidemics, i.e., at low symptom frequency. @lowe2017 reviewed hyperspectral imaging of plant diseases, focusing on early detection of diseases for crop monitoring. They report several analysis techniques successfully used for the detection of biotic and abiotic stresses with reported levels of accuracy higher than 80%.

@lowe2017 state that remote sensing of diseases under production conditions is challenging because of variable environmental factors and crop-intrinsic characteristics, e.g., 3D architecture, various growth stages, variety of diseases that may occur simultaneously, and the high sensitivity required to reliably perceive low disease levels suitable for decision-making in disease control. The use of less sensitive systems may be restricted to the assessment of crop damage and yield losses due to diseases.

### UAV applications for plant disease detection and monitoring

@kouadio2023 undertook a systematic quantitative literature review to summarize existing literature in UAV-based applications for plant disease detection and monitoring. Results reveal a global disparity in research on the topic, with Asian countries being the top contributing countries. World regions such as Oceania and Africa exhibit comparatively lesser representation. To date, research has largely focused on diseases affecting wheat, sugar beet, potato, maize, and grapevine [@fig-RS11]. Multispectral, red-green-blue, and hyperspectral sensors were most often used to detect and identify disease symptoms, with current trends pointing to approaches integrating multiple sensors and the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques. The authors suggest that future research should prioritize (i) development of cost-effective and user-friendly UAVs, (ii) integration with emerging agricultural technologies, (iii) improved data acquisition and processing efficiency (iv) diverse testing scenarios, and (v) ethical considerations through proper regulations.
